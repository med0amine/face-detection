This is a face recognition system for Raspberry Pi. It is a contenue of the security robot project but the detection pressess is more optimise, precise and up to 60 frames per second.

The system takes the video from the Raspberry Pi camera and searches for a person's face, if it detects a human face it will frame the face with an accuracy percentage.

The program was installed on a Raspberry Pi 4 using an RPi Camera 2.

The software was written in Python using open CV, imutils, mediapipe and numpy libraries.
